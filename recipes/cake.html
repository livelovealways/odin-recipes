        <h1>Steps</h1>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.</li>
                <li>Butter two 9-inch-round cake pans and line the bottoms with parchment paper; butter the parchment and dust the pans with flour, tapping out the excess.</li>
                <li>Whisk 3 cups flour, the baking powder and salt in a bowl until combined.</li>
                <li>Beat 2 sticks butter and the sugar in a large bowl with a mixer on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes.</li>
                <li>Reduce the mixer speed to medium; beat in the eggs, one at a time, scraping down the bowl as needed.</li>
                <li>Beat in the vanilla. (The mixture may look separated at this point.)</li>
                <li>Beat in the flour mixture in 3 batches, alternating with the milk, beginning and ending with flour, until just smooth.</li>
                <li>Divide the batter between the prepared pans. </li>
                <li>Bake until the cakes are lightly golden on top and a toothpick inserted into the middle comes out clean, 30 to 35 minutes.</li>
                <li>Transfer to racks and let cool 10 minutes, then run a knife around the edge of the pans and turn the cakes out onto the racks to cool completely.</li>
                <li>Remove the parchment. Trim the tops of the cakes with a long serrated knife to make them level, if desired.</li>
            </ol>
