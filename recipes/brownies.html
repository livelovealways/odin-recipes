        <h1>Steps</h1>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 350 F.</li>
                <li>Combine all ingredients except chips in a good food processor, and blend until completely smooth. Really blend well. (A blender can work if you absolutely must, but the texture—and even the taste—will be much better in a food processor. I use this food processor.)</li>
                <li>Stir in the chips, then pour into a greased 8×8 pan. Optional: sprinkle extra chocolate chips over the top.</li>
                <li>Cook the black bean brownies 15-18 minutes, then let cool at least 10 minutes before trying to cut. If they still look a bit undercooked, you can place them in the fridge overnight and they will magically firm up!</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Makes 9-12 brownies.</p>
